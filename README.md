## Cupio
Cupio (/'ˈku.pi.oː/, from latin: *to desire, to crave*) -- is a real-time computer graphics technical demo developed in Rust with Vulkan API.

It's a quintessence of my desire:
* to make a fast and well designed rendering with Entity Component System
* to make beautiful sceneries with it

I hereby solemnly vow to work on this pet project to prove to the world that I'm worthy. I hope it will be an example for those interested in either Rust, Vulkan API or computer graphics in general.

But you know the drill:
